# W&B Hyperparameter Sweeps Engine

This repo contains routines that will be used to generate hyperparameter sweep suggestions in upcoming releases of the W&B backend and [client](https://github.com/wandb/client) local controller.
This repo is currently under development and is not currently a part of the backend or client.

For now, please [open issues related to sweeps in the wandb client library github issues page](https://github.com/wandb/client/issues/new/choose).
